# Crystal Collector Game!
This is a small game based on random number generator. It works in the following manner:
- This game generates a random number each time the game starts or after each WIN or LOSE, which is visible to the user. 
- A random number is also assigned to each crystal whenever the a LOSE or WIN occurs or the game starts, which are hidden to the user
- User clicks on the crystals to get and remember the number
- The crystal random values are added consecutively
- When the added values of crystals EQUAL to the visible number, The user WINS otherwise the user loses. 
- This process continues each time a visible-random number is generated
